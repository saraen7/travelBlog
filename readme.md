# Travel Blog Read Me
This is a travel blog that I created to showcase some of the places I've traveled and some of the places I hope to go.

**Link to project:** http://saratravelsthe.world/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery

I relied heavily on using image carousels to display images.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot about project creep. There are so many places that I'd like to highlight that it was difficult to pick just a few for this site. I also learned about hosting with Netlify and purchasing a domain.
