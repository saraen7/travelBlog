To Do:

Add a "featured" carousel for the home page

Add a "Home" button to the nav

Write out at least two articles 

Then templatize an article page and create a coming soon page for the other articles

Add more N. America places and create a carousel withint the menu

Eventually change Nav to be replicated using PHP. Maybe use this tutorial: http://www.apaddedcell.com/how-automatically-include-your-header-navigation-and-footer-every-page
